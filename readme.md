This is a utility that will update your desktop wallpaper from your Google Photos library on a custom schedule.

### Features

- Select the photo albums that you'd like to use, and your wallpaper will change automatically either in sequence or random order.
- Filter photos that are too small, have a poor aspect ratio, or create a custom blacklist.
- Previous, next, and random buttons to quickly change the wallpaper, or select one from the album list.
